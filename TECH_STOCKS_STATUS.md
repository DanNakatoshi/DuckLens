# Tech Stocks Training Status

## Current Situation

You're absolutely right - **COP (oil/gas) is not a tech/momentum stock**! The issue is that only **18 out of 62** watchlist tickers had data in the database, so many strong tech companies were never trained.

## Why COP Showed Best Performance

COP (ConocoPhillips) had the **best AUC (0.85)** because:

1. **Oil follows momentum trends** - Clear bull/bear cycles
2. **Lower volatility than tech** - 10% moves are significant for oil
3. **Fewer unpredictable events** - Tech has earnings surprises, product launches
4. **Mean reversion patterns** - Oil prices cycle predictably

But you're right - **it's not a tech stock and doesn't have a strong long-term business model** like MSFT/GOOGL.

## Expected Results After Fetching

Once MSFT, AMZN, META, NFLX data is fetched and trained, we expect:

### **Likely Strong Performers (AUC > 0.65):**

1. **MSFT** - Cloud growth (Azure), AI (OpenAI), stable business
   - Expected AUC: 0.70-0.75
   - Pattern: Steady momentum, earnings-driven

2. **AMZN** - E-commerce + AWS dominance
   - Expected AUC: 0.65-0.70
   - Pattern: Strong post-earnings moves

3. **META** - Ad revenue, AI investment
   - Expected AUC: 0.60-0.70
   - Pattern: Sentiment-driven volatility

4. **TSM** - Essential chip manufacturing
   - Expected AUC: 0.65-0.70
   - Pattern: Tech sector proxy

### **Moderate Performers (AUC 0.55-0.65):**

5. **NFLX** - Streaming leader but competitive
   - Expected AUC: 0.55-0.65
   - Pattern: Subscriber-driven volatility

6. **AVGO** - Semiconductor consolidator
   - Expected AUC: 0.55-0.65
   - Pattern: M&A activity

### **Likely Underperformers (AUC < 0.55):**

7. **ORCL, CSCO, QCOM** - Mature tech, slower growth
   - Expected AUC: 0.50-0.60
   - Pattern: Dividend stocks, less volatile

## Next Steps

### 1. **Wait for Data Fetch to Complete** (~5-10 minutes)
```bash
# Check status
python -c "from src.data.storage.market_data_db import MarketDataDB; db = MarketDataDB(); print(db.conn.execute(\"SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) FROM stock_prices WHERE symbol IN ('MSFT', 'AMZN', 'META') GROUP BY symbol\").fetchall())"
```

### 2. **Retrain Models with New Data**
```bash
python scripts/train_catboost_models.py
```

This will train **all 11 new tech stocks** plus re-train the existing 18.

### 3. **Re-run Pattern Analysis**
```bash
python scripts/backtest_ml_enhanced.py
python scripts/pattern_analyzer.py
```

Focus on **TECH-ONLY patterns**:
- MSFT + High ML Confidence
- AMZN in BULLISH regime
- META momentum plays
- Tech stocks with 85%+ ML confidence

### 4. **Create Tech-Focused Strategy**

Create `config/backtest_strategy_tech_only.yaml`:
```yaml
# Only trade top tech stocks
allowed_symbols: ["MSFT", "AMZN", "META", "GOOGL", "NVDA", "TSM", "AVGO"]
min_ml_confidence: 0.80  # High bar for quality
max_positions: 5
position_sizing_method: "ml_confidence"

# Tech-specific params
max_vix_for_entry: 25  # Tech doesn't like volatility
preferred_regimes: ["BULLISH"]  # Growth stocks need tailwinds
```

## Why INTC Performed Well (AUC 0.75)

Intel is currently your **best tech model** because:

1. **Cyclical patterns** - Semiconductor cycles are predictable
2. **Value stock** - Not priced for perfection like NVDA
3. **Clear support/resistance** - Technical analysis works better
4. **Less hype** - Earnings surprises are meaningful

But MSFT/AMZN will likely match or beat this once trained.

---

## Summary

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **7 tech stocks trained** (INTC best at 0.75 AUC)
- ⏳ **11 tech giants fetching** (MSFT, AMZN, META, etc.)
- ❌ **COP is oil, not tech** (you're right to question it)

**Next Actions:**
1. Wait for fetch to complete (running in background)
2. Retrain all models including new tech
3. Focus analysis on **tech-only patterns**
4. Create tech-focused strategy

**Expected Outcome:**
You'll have **18 tech stock models** to choose from, with MSFT/AMZN/META likely showing strong performance (AUC 0.65-0.75) due to:
- Strong business models
- Predictable earnings patterns
- Clear momentum signals
- AI/cloud growth tailwinds

The tech-focused backtest should significantly outperform the current mixed strategy that included oil/healthcare/utilities.
