## 🚀 Usage

### Standard Backtest (Summary Only)
```powershell
.\tasks.ps1 train-backtest
```

### Verbose Backtest (With Reasoning Log)
```powershell
.\tasks.ps1 train-verbose
```

This creates `trade_reasoning.log` with detailed explanations.

### Custom Configuration
```powershell
# Higher threshold = more cash-on-sidelines
poetry run python scripts/train_and_backtest_verbose.py `
    --min-confidence 0.70 `
    --log-file my_trades.log
```

## 🎯 Key Insights from Reasoning

### 1. See Why You're Winning
```
Entry: SUPPORT_RECLAIM
Exit: TAKE_PROFIT
Result: +18.5% in 21 days

Reasoning shows: "Price reclaimed $500 support after dip to $485"
→ Support levels are working well for entries
```

### 2. See Why You're Losing
```
Entry: ML_PREDICTION (65% confidence)
Exit: STOP_LOSS
Result: -8.0% in 3 days

Reasoning shows: "ML predicted UP but RSI was already 72 (overbought)"
→ Maybe add RSI filter to ML signals
```

### 3. See When You're Sitting Out
```
Rejected: 142 signals (33%)
Cash-on-Sidelines: 19.4% of days

Reasoning shows: "Most rejections during sideways market (RSI 45-55)"
→ System correctly avoids choppy conditions
```

## 💡 Configuration Examples

### Conservative (Sit Out Often)
```powershell
poetry run python scripts/train_and_backtest_verbose.py --min-confidence 0.75
```
**Effect**:
- Rejection rate: ~45%
- Cash-on-sidelines: ~30%
- Higher win rate, lower total return

### Moderate (Balanced)
```powershell
poetry run python scripts/train_and_backtest_verbose.py --min-confidence 0.60
```
**Effect**:
- Rejection rate: ~25%
- Cash-on-sidelines: ~15%
- Balanced win rate and return

### Aggressive (Trade Often)
```powershell
poetry run python scripts/train_and_backtest_verbose.py --min-confidence 0.50
```
**Effect**:
- Rejection rate: ~10%
- Cash-on-sidelines: ~5%
- More trades, higher volatility

## 📖 Reading the Reasoning

### Entry Signals

**🔵 SUPPORT RECLAIM**
- What: Price dipped below support, bounced back
- Good when: Support is clear and recent
- Risk: False breakout, more downside

**🚀 BREAKOUT**
- What: Price breaks above recent high
- Good when: Strong volume confirmation
- Risk: Bull trap, reversal at resistance

**📉➡️📈 OVERSOLD BOUNCE**
- What: RSI < 30 + MACD turns bullish
- Good when: Overall trend still up
- Risk: Catching falling knife in downtrend

**🤖 ML PREDICTION**
- What: CatBoost model sees favorable pattern
- Good when: Confidence > 70%
- Risk: Model overfitting or regime change

**💪 MOMENTUM**
- What: Multiple bullish indicators align
- Good when: Options flow + MACD + RSI all agree
- Risk: Late to trend, near top

### Exit Signals

**🛑 STOP LOSS**
- What: Hit stop loss level
- Why: Preserve capital, cut losses early
- Note: Track if stops are too tight

**🎯 TAKE PROFIT**
- What: Hit profit target
- Why: Lock in gains at predefined level
- Note: Best exits, never regret

**📉 TRAILING STOP**
- What: Dropped from peak by trailing %
- Why: Let winners run, exit on reversal
- Note: Protects gains from big winners

**⏰ TIME EXIT**
- What: Held max days
- Why: Free up capital for new opportunities
- Note: Check if P&L is flat at exit

**🚧 RESISTANCE HIT**
- What: Approached resistance level
- Why: High probability of reversal
- Note: Compare to actual resistance accuracy

**📊 OVERBOUGHT**
- What: RSI > 75 + MACD turned negative
- Why: Momentum exhaustion
- Note: Good for taking profits near top

**🤖 ML SELL SIGNAL**
- What: Model predicts down move
- Why: Bearish pattern detected
- Note: Track ML sell signal accuracy

## 🔍 Using Reasoning to Improve Strategy

### Step 1: Run Verbose Backtest
```powershell
.\tasks.ps1 train-verbose
```

### Step 2: Analyze Reasoning Log
```powershell
# Count different entry reasons
grep "BUY SIGNAL" trade_reasoning.log | wc -l

# Find all cash-on-sidelines decisions
grep "CASH ON SIDELINES" trade_reasoning.log

# See all stop losses
grep "STOP LOSS HIT" trade_reasoning.log
```

### Step 3: Identify Patterns
Look for:
- **Best entry types**: Which signals have highest win rate?
- **Worst entry types**: Which signals lead to stop losses?
- **Optimal confidence threshold**: Where is sweet spot?
- **Cash periods**: When is system sitting out? (Good or bad?)

### Step 4: Adjust Strategy
Based on findings:

```python
# If OVERSOLD_BOUNCE has low win rate:
# → Add stricter filter in trading_strategy.py

elif (
    indicators.get("rsi_14") and indicators["rsi_14"] < 30
    and indicators.get("macd_histogram") and indicators["macd_histogram"] > 0
    and indicators.get("sma_20") and indicators.get("sma_50")
    and indicators["sma_20"] > indicators["sma_50"]  # ← ADD: Only if uptrend
):
    entry_reason = EntryReason.OVERSOLD_BOUNCE
```

## 📈 Metrics to Track

### From Reasoning Log

1. **Signal Quality**
   - Signals generated: How many opportunities?
   - Signals rejected: How selective?
   - Rejection rate: 20-40% is healthy

2. **Cash Management**
   - Cash-on-sidelines days: When uncertain, sit out
   - Target: 10-25% depending on strategy
   - Too low (< 5%): Maybe too aggressive
   - Too high (> 40%): Maybe too conservative

3. **Entry/Exit Distribution**
   - Which signals fire most often?
   - Which have best win rate?
   - Which have best profit factor?

### Example Analysis

```
Entry Breakdown (from reasoning log):
- BREAKOUT_HIGH: 45 signals, 62% win rate, +$18k
- SUPPORT_RECLAIM: 38 signals, 58% win rate, +$12k
- ML_PREDICTION: 31 signals, 54% win rate, +$8k
- OVERSOLD_BOUNCE: 22 signals, 45% win rate, -$2k ← PROBLEM!

Exit Breakdown:
- TAKE_PROFIT: 68 exits (47%) ← Good
- TRAILING_STOP: 31 exits (21%) ← Good
- STOP_LOSS: 40 exits (28%) ← Acceptable
- TIME_EXIT: 6 exits (4%) ← Low, good

Action: Remove or fix OVERSOLD_BOUNCE signal
```

## 🛠️ Advanced: Using Reasoning with External Tools

### Option 1: Python Analysis
```python
import re

with open("trade_reasoning.log", "r") as f:
    log = f.read()

# Extract all buy signals
buys = re.findall(r"🟢 BUY SIGNAL: (\w+)", log)
print(f"Total buys: {len(buys)}")

# Extract all reasons
reasons = re.findall(r"(🔵|🚀|📉➡️📈|🤖|💪) (\w+)", log)
print(f"Reason distribution: {Counter([r[1] for r in reasons])}")
```

### Option 2: Use Ollama for Analysis

If you have Ollama installed:

```powershell
# Summarize reasoning log with Ollama
ollama run llama2 "Analyze this trading log and tell me the top 3 most common reasons for wins and losses: $(Get-Content trade_reasoning.log)"
```

Example prompt:
```
"Read this trading log and answer:
1. What entry signal has the best win rate?
2. What exit reason is most common?
3. When does the system sit in cash the most?
4. What recommendations do you have?

[paste relevant sections of trade_reasoning.log]"
```
