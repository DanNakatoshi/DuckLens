## Recommended Simple Allocation

### Option 1: Set-and-Forget (Easiest)
**Just use a Target Date Fund matching your retirement year:**

If you're retiring around:
- 2055-2060: Use **CG 2055 TD T9** or **CG 2060 TD T9**
- 2050-2055: Use **CG 2050 TD T9**

**Action:** Sell all current holdings → Buy 100% into one target date fund → Enable auto-rebalance

**Pros:** Auto-rebalances, already diversified, no thinking required
**Cons:** Less control, may be too conservative as retirement approaches

---

### Option 2: DIY Allocation (More Control)

**Recommended Mix for Growth (Age 30-45):**

```
50% - SP 500 INDEX PL CL F          (Large cap core)
20% - SP INTL INDEX F               (International diversification)
15% - SP Small CP IND CL F          (Small cap growth)
10% - FIAM US BOND INX D            (Bond stability)
5%  - FID CONTRA POOL CL F          (Active management)
```
