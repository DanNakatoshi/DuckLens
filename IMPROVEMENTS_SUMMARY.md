## ✅ Completed: Configurable Backtest Strategy

### Simple Improvements Applied (No ML Yet)

#### 1. **Momentum Filters Enabled** 🎯
- ✅ Price must be 5%+ above 20-day MA
- ✅ Volume must be 1.5x average (strong buying)
- ✅ Breakout mode: Only buy stocks near 6-month highs
- **Goal**: Filter out choppy/weak stocks

#### 2. **Regime-Based Risk Management** 📊

**BULLISH Regime (VIX < 20):**
- 12% stop-loss (wider to avoid whipsaws)
- 25% take-profit (let winners run)
- 1.5x moderate leverage
- More aggressive position sizing

**NEUTRAL Regime (VIX 20-30):**
- 10% stop-loss
- 15% take-profit
- 0.5x position sizing (defensive)
- Higher confidence required (80%+)

**BEARISH Regime (VIX > 30):**
- 8% stop-loss
- 12% take-profit (quick exits)
- 0.2x minimal exposure
- Only trade 90%+ confidence signals
- **Mostly sit in cash**

#### 3. **Fewer, Better Positions** 💎
- **5 positions max** (was 12)
- Less diversification drag
- Bigger size on high-conviction trades
- Lower transaction costs

#### 4. **VIX Entry Filter** 🛡️
- **Only trade when VIX < 25** (was 35)
- Avoid opening positions during fear spikes
- Cash is a position in uncertain markets

#### 5. **Wider Stops** 📈
- BULLISH: 12% (was 10%)
- NEUTRAL: 10% (was 8%)
- BEARISH: 8% (was 6%)
- Reduces whipsaw losses

## Expected Results

### Before (Original Strategy):
- ❌ -64% loss over 5 years
- ❌ 46% win rate
- ❌ 541 trades (high churn)
- ❌ Transaction costs killed edge

### After (Improved Strategy):
Target improvements:
- 🎯 **50-55% win rate** (momentum filters)
- 🎯 **100-200 trades** (more selective)
- 🎯 **+10-30% return** (vs -64%)
- 🎯 **Lower drawdowns** (regime adaptation)

**Reality Check**: This WON'T reach $1M from $30K in 5 years. That requires:
- 70%+ win rate (unrealistic), OR
- 3-5x leverage (very risky), OR
- 10-15 year timeframe

But it should **stop losing money** and provide a solid foundation.

## How to Test

### Run Improved Backtest:
```powershell
.\menu.ps1
# Select option 14: "Backtest Custom"
```

### Customize Further:
Edit `config/backtest_strategy.yaml` to adjust:
- Stop-loss percentages
- Confidence thresholds
- Momentum filter strictness
- Max positions
- VIX limits

---

## Next Steps (If Needed)

### If Still Losing Money:
1. **Try CatBoost ML** - Use machine learning for better signal quality
2. **Add sector rotation** - Only trade leading sectors
3. **Switch to different strategy** - Maybe trend-following doesn't work in this period

### If Breaking Even or Small Gains:
1. **Increase position size** on highest confidence (85%+)
2. **Add pyramiding** - Add to winners
3. **Consider modest leverage** (1.5-2x) on BULLISH regime only

### If Making +20-30%:
1. **CatBoost could amplify** to +40-50%
2. **Optimize entry timing** with ML
3. **Dynamic position sizing** based on predicted returns
