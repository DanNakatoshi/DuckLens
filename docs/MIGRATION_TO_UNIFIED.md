# Migration Guide: Unified Market Check

## Quick Start

The new **Unified Market Check** replaces both `morning_check.py` and `intraday_monitor_enhanced.py` with a single intelligent script.

## What Changed?

### ‚úÖ New Unified Script
- **[scripts/market_check.py](../scripts/market_check.py)** - One script for all-day monitoring

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Old Scripts (Still Available)
- `scripts/morning_check.py` - Still works, but use unified instead
- `scripts/intraday_monitor_enhanced.py` - Still works, but use unified instead

## Menu Changes

### Old Menu (Before)
```
1  Morning Check      - Pre-market analysis and buy signals
2  Intraday Monitor   - 3 PM check with morning signal tracking
```

### New Menu (Now)
```
1  Market Check       - Smart all-day monitor (auto-detects market status)
2  Market Check LIVE  - Auto-refresh during market hours (live prices)
```

## Workflow Migration

### Old Daily Workflow
```powershell
# Morning (before 9:30 AM)
.\tasks.ps1 morning

# Afternoon (3 PM)
.\tasks.ps1 intraday-plus
```

### New Unified Workflow
```powershell
# Morning (before 9:30 AM) - Static mode
.\tasks.ps1 market-check

# During market hours (9:30 AM - 4 PM) - Live mode
.\tasks.ps1 market-check --live

# After hours - Static mode
.\tasks.ps1 market-check
```

## Interactive Menu Usage

### Option 1: Market Check (Static)
- **When**: Pre-market, after-hours, weekend
- **Data**: Historical/close prices from database
- **Behavior**: Single snapshot, no refresh

### Option 2: Market Check LIVE
- **When**: During market hours (9:30 AM - 4 PM ET)
- **Data**: Live prices (15-min delayed from Polygon.io)
- **Behavior**: Auto-refreshes every 60 seconds
- **Stop**: Press Ctrl+C

## What's the Same?

All the sections you're familiar with are still there:
- ‚úÖ Account Summary (cash, portfolio, margin)
- ‚úÖ Market Direction (SPY/QQQ signals)
- ‚úÖ Holdings Analysis (P/L, signals, actions)
- ‚úÖ Watchlist (top buy opportunities)
- ‚úÖ Portfolio Optimization (health score)
- ‚úÖ Today's Game Plan (action items)

## What's Better?

### 1. Smart Market Detection
```
PRE_MARKET    ‚Üí Shows yesterday's close
MARKET_OPEN   ‚Üí Shows live prices (15-min delayed)
AFTER_HOURS   ‚Üí Shows today's 4 PM close
WEEKEND       ‚Üí Shows Friday's close
```

### 2. Live Data Indicators
```
[green]LIVE (15m delay)[/green]  ‚Üí Real-time data
[green]‚óè[/green]                  ‚Üí Live price marker
[dim]DB[/dim]                     ‚Üí Database/historical
```

### 3. Signal Change Tracking
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGED: BUY‚ÜíSELL - SELL NOW!
‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGED: SELL‚ÜíHOLD - CAUTION!
```

### 4. Auto-Refresh
- Runs continuously during market hours
- Configurable refresh rate (default 60s)
- Smart: only refreshes when market is open

## Command Reference

### Via Menu
```powershell
.\menu.ps1
# Then select option 1 or 2
```

### Via Tasks (Static)
```powershell
.\tasks.ps1 market-check
```

### Via Tasks (Live)
```powershell
# Default 60-second refresh
.\tasks.ps1 market-check --live

# Custom 5-minute refresh
.\tasks.ps1 market-check --live --interval 300
```

### Direct Python
```powershell
# Static
python scripts/market_check.py

# Live with default 60s
python scripts/market_check.py --live

# Live with custom interval
python scripts/market_check.py --live --interval 120
```

## Transition Period

### Can I Still Use Old Scripts?
**Yes!** The old scripts are still available:
```powershell
.\tasks.ps1 morning          # Still works
.\tasks.ps1 intraday-plus    # Still works
```

### When Should I Switch?
**Now!** The unified script has all the same features plus:
- ‚úÖ Less code duplication
- ‚úÖ Smarter data handling
- ‚úÖ Auto-refresh capability
- ‚úÖ Better signal tracking

### Will Old Scripts Be Removed?
Not immediately. They'll remain for a transition period, but the unified script is now the **recommended** approach.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Live mode shows "DB" instead of "LIVE"
**A:** This is normal when market is closed. Live mode only works during market hours (9:30 AM - 4 PM ET).

### Q: Auto-refresh exits immediately
**A:** The market is closed. Auto-refresh only activates during market hours.

### Q: I see "CHANGED: SELL‚ÜíHOLD" - what does this mean?
**A:** The morning showed SELL, but price bounced intraday. Use caution - the original weakness may still be present. See [docs/UNDERSTANDING_SIGNAL_CHANGES.md](UNDERSTANDING_SIGNAL_CHANGES.md) for details.

### Q: How do I stop auto-refresh?
**A:** Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop the refresh loop.

### Q: Can I customize the refresh rate?
**A:** Yes! Use `--interval` flag:
```powershell
.\tasks.ps1 market-check --live --interval 300  # 5 minutes
```
