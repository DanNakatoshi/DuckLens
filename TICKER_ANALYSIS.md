## Summary: YES, Add Major Tickers!

**Critical Gaps to Fill:**
1. ‚ùå **MSFT** - Cannot trade without Microsoft (Cloud/AI leader)
2. ‚ùå **AMZN** - Cannot trade without Amazon (AWS dominance)
3. ‚ùå **JPM** - No financial sector representation
4. ‚ùå **V/MA** - No payment processor exposure
5. ‚ùå **META** - Missing major social media/AI play

**Your current list is heavily weighted toward:**
- ‚úÖ Technology (good - largest sector)
- ‚úÖ Energy (5 stocks, but 3 are low-quality)
- ‚ùå Missing Financials, Communication Services completely

**Action Items:**
1. Add TIER 1 Priority stocks (MSFT, AMZN, JPM, V, MA, META, TSM)
2. Clean up underperformers (BE, CSIQ, EPSM all have terrible R/R ratios)
3. Consider dropping UPS (-45% loss, death cross)
4. Result: ~30 high-quality stocks across ALL major sectors

This will give you:
- Better diversification
- Access to the 7 largest S&P 500 stocks (you're missing MSFT #2, AMZN #4)
- Financial sector exposure (critical for market cycles)
- Better stock selection when multiple BUY signals appear
