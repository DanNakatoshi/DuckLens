## The Math

### Position Sizing by Market Regime

| Market Regime | Positions | Per Position | Leverage | Reason |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|----------|---------|
| **BULL** | 3-4 | $7.5K-$10K | 2x on best | Aggressive growth |
| **NEUTRAL** | 4-5 | $6K-$7.5K | 1.5x on best | Balanced approach |
| **VOLATILE** | 5-6 | $5K-$6K | 1x only | Risk management |
| **BEAR** | 0-1 | $3K-$5K | No leverage | Capital preservation |

## Detailed Breakdown

### Bull Market ($30K → 3-4 positions)

**Example Portfolio:**
```
Position 1: NVDA @ $425 (STRONG BUY, score 4.85)
  - Confidence: 98%
  - Entry: EXCELLENT
  - Allocation: 40% = $12,000 (2x leverage = $24,000 exposure)

Position 2: AAPL @ $180 (STRONG BUY, score 3.90)
  - Confidence: 95%
  - Entry: EXCELLENT
  - Allocation: 35% = $10,500 (2x leverage = $21,000 exposure)

Position 3: AMD @ $145 (GOOD BUY, score 2.60)
  - Confidence: 77%
  - Entry: FAIR
  - Allocation: 25% = $7,500 (1x = $7,500 exposure)

Total: $30,000 cash → $52,500 exposure (1.75x effective leverage)
```

**Why 3-4?**
- Focus capital on highest conviction plays
- 2x leverage on top 2 signals amplifies returns
- Remaining positions for diversification

### Neutral Market ($30K → 4-5 positions)

**Example Portfolio:**
```
Position 1: MSFT @ $410 (GOOD BUY, score 3.20)
  - Allocation: 25% = $7,500 (1.5x leverage = $11,250 exposure)

Position 2: GOOGL @ $142 (GOOD BUY, score 2.90)
  - Allocation: 25% = $7,500 (1.5x leverage = $11,250 exposure)

Position 3: META @ $520 (FAIR BUY, score 2.40)
  - Allocation: 20% = $6,000 (1x = $6,000 exposure)

Position 4: TSLA @ $245 (FAIR BUY, score 2.10)
  - Allocation: 20% = $6,000 (1x = $6,000 exposure)

Position 5: CASH
  - 10% = $3,000 (reserve for opportunities)

Total: $27,000 invested → $34,500 exposure (1.28x effective leverage)
```

**Why 4-5?**
- More diversification in mixed conditions
- Moderate leverage on best signals
- Cash reserve for new opportunities

---

### Volatile Market ($30K → 5-6 positions)

**Example Portfolio:**
```
Position 1: SPY (safer, broad market)
  - Allocation: 20% = $6,000 (1x = $6,000 exposure)

Position 2: AAPL
  - Allocation: 18% = $5,400 (1x = $5,400 exposure)

Position 3: MSFT
  - Allocation: 16% = $4,800 (1x = $4,800 exposure)

Position 4: QQQ
  - Allocation: 16% = $4,800 (1x = $4,800 exposure)

Position 5: DIS
  - Allocation: 15% = $4,500 (1x = $4,500 exposure)

Position 6: CASH
  - 15% = $4,500 (large reserve)

Total: $25,500 invested → $25,500 exposure (NO leverage when VIX > 25)
```

**Why 5-6?**
- Spread risk across more positions
- NO leverage in volatile conditions
- Larger cash cushion (15%)

---

### Bear Market ($30K → 0-1 positions)

**Recommendation: STAY IN CASH**

If you must trade:
```
Position 1: QQQ or SPY ONLY (market leaders bounce first)
  - Allocation: 10-15% = $3,000-$4,500
  - NO LEVERAGE
  - Tight stop loss (5-7%)

Cash: 85-90% = $25,500-$27,000
```

**Why 0-1?**
- Preserve capital for next bull market
- Even great stocks drop 30-50% in bears
- Better to wait than lose money

---

## Position Sizing Rules

### Rule 1: Never Risk More Than 2% Per Position

```
$30,000 × 2% = $600 max loss per trade

Example:
- Buy AAPL @ $180
- Stop loss @ $171 (5% below)
- Max position = $600 / $9 loss = ~$6,667

Even with 2x leverage, still only risk $600 total
```

### Rule 2: Scale Position Size by Confidence

| Adjusted Confidence | Position Size | Max Leverage |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------|
| 95-100% | 30-40% | 2x |
| 85-94% | 20-30% | 1.5x |
| 75-84% | 15-20% | 1x |
| 70-74% | 10-15% | 1x |
| < 70% | 0% (don't trade) | 0x |

### Rule 3: Reduce Position Size for Earnings

If stock has earnings in 3-10 days:
```
Normal position: $10,000
Earnings risk: -50% = $5,000 position size
```

### Rule 4: Reduce Position Size for Poor Entry

If entry quality is POOR (near resistance):
```
Normal position: $10,000
Poor entry penalty: -30% = $7,000 position size
```

## Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Bull market, you get 5 BUY signals

### Signals From Morning Check:
```
1. NVDA  - Score: 4.85, Conf: 98%, Entry: GOOD
2. AAPL  - Score: 3.90, Conf: 95%, Entry: EXCELLENT
3. MSFT  - Score: 3.20, Conf: 88%, Entry: GOOD
4. AMD   - Score: 2.60, Conf: 77%, Entry: FAIR (earnings in 8 days!)
5. TSLA  - Score: 2.10, Conf: 72%, Entry: POOR
```

### Your Actions:
```
✅ NVDA: 40% × $30K = $12,000 (2x leverage)
   - Top score, high confidence, good entry
   - Exposure: $24,000

✅ AAPL: 35% × $30K = $10,500 (2x leverage)
   - Excellent entry near support
   - Exposure: $21,000

✅ MSFT: 20% × $30K = $6,000 (1x)
   - Good signal but tier 2
   - Exposure: $6,000

❌ AMD: SKIP or $1,500 only
   - Earnings in 8 days = -50% size
   - Would be $3,000 → reduce to $1,500

❌ TSLA: SKIP
   - Poor entry near resistance
   - Low score, not worth it

Cash Reserve: 5% = $1,500
```

**Result:**
- 3 strong positions
- Total invested: $28,500
- Total exposure: $51,000 (1.79x effective leverage)
- Concentrated on best opportunities

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Many Positions
```
10 positions × $3,000 each = Can't monitor all
Better: 3-5 positions you can watch closely
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Equal Weight Everything
```
Bad: Every position gets 20% regardless of quality
Good: Top signals get 30-40%, weak signals get 10-15%
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Full Leverage Always
```
Bad: 2x leverage on every trade
Good: 2x only on 95%+ confidence, EXCELLENT entries
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Cash Reserve
```
Bad: 100% invested, can't add on dips
Good: Keep 5-15% cash for opportunities
```

### ❌ Mistake 5: Ignore Market Regime
```
Bad: Same strategy in bull and bear markets
Good: 3-4 positions in bull, 0-1 in bear
```
