## Expected Impact on Returns

### Scenario 1: Bull Market (SPY up 20%+)
**Before:** Tech-heavy → catch most upside
**After:** Tech + Financials + Consumer → catch MORE upside (financials rally in bull markets)

### Scenario 2: Bear Market (SPY down 20%+)
**Before:** No defensive sectors → full drawdown
**After:** Consumer staples, healthcare hold up → smaller drawdown, faster recovery

### Scenario 3: Sector Rotation
**Before:** If tech corrects, entire watchlist suffers
**After:** Energy up, healthcare up, consumer up → always have BUY signals somewhere

### Expected Annual Return Improvement:
- **Before:** 50-60% (concentrated, higher risk)
- **After:** 50-70% (diversified, SAME upside, LOWER risk)

**Why?** More opportunities to deploy capital optimally across sectors, better protection during corrections.
