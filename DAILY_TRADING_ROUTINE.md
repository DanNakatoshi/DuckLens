## üí° **Pro Tips**

### **Avoid Emotional Trading:**
- ‚úì Stick to the signals - don't override based on "gut feeling"
- ‚úì If signal says SELL, sell (even if you like the stock)
- ‚úì If signal says WAIT, wait (even if you want to buy)

### **Position Sizing:**
- Start with **10-20 shares per stock** (~$1,000-2,000 per position)
- Max **5-8 positions** at once (diversification)
- Keep **25-50% cash** (for opportunities)

### **Don't Chase:**
- If you miss a 3 PM entry, **wait for next day**
- Better to miss a trade than buy at the top

### **Use Limit Orders:**
- Don't use market orders (you'll get bad fills)
- Set limit at current price or $0.05-0.10 below
- Example: Stock at $173.50 ‚Üí Set limit buy at $173.45

## ‚ùì **FAQ**

**Q: What if I can't trade at 3 PM?**
A: Set price alerts on E*TRADE. If buy signal hits your target, place limit order for next day.

**Q: What if market is crazy volatile?**
A: Check VXX. If VXX > 50, sit in cash. Don't trade during crashes.

**Q: How many trades per week is normal?**
A: 1-3 trades per week. You're trend-following (300-500 day holds), not day trading.

**Q: Should I use stop losses?**
A: Yes! Death cross IS your stop loss. Exit when SMA_50 < SMA_200.

**Q: What if I disagree with a signal?**
A: The strategy has 94% win rate. Trust the system. Override at your own risk.

**Q: Can I check more than 3 PM?**
A: Yes, but don't overtrade. More checking = more emotional decisions.
