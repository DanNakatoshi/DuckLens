## Implementation

Should I:

**Option A: Add Tier 1 (34 tickers total)**
- Essential 15 new tickers
- High prediction value
- ~5-10 min to fetch historical

**Option B: Add Both Tiers (50 tickers total)**
- Complete prediction system
- All macro indicators
- ~10-20 min to fetch historical

**Option C: You choose specific ones**
- Custom list based on your needs

## My Recommendation: **Option A (Tier 1)**

The 15 additional Tier 1 tickers give you:
- ✅ Fear/Volatility tracking (VIX, UVXY, SVXY)
