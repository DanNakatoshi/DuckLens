# Backtest: $30K to $1M Path

## Overview

This backtest simulates realistic trading from $30,000 to $1,000,000 using the Enhanced Trend Detector with proper risk management, leverage, and NO FUTURE DATA LEAKAGE.

## Key Features

### 1. **No Future Data Leakage (Walk-Forward Simulation)**
- Processes data day-by-day in chronological order
- Detectors initialized per-date using only historical data
- Signals generated using data available up to that specific date
- No peeking ahead or using future information

### 2. **Realistic Transaction Costs**
- **Commission**: 0.1% per trade (both entry and exit)
- **Slippage**: 0.05% (market impact)
- Costs deducted from both buying and selling

### 3. **Dynamic Leverage Based on Confidence & Market Regime**

| Confidence | Market Regime | Leverage | Description |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| â‰¥85% | BULLISH | **2.0x** | Aggressive - high confidence opportunities |
| 75-85% | BULLISH | **1.5x** | Moderate leverage |
| â‰¥75% | NEUTRAL | **1.0x** | No leverage - standard position |
| Any | BEARISH | **0.5x** | Defensive - reduce exposure |

### 4. **Position Sizing (Kelly Criterion)**

Position size = (Portfolio Value Ã— Leverage Ã— Kelly%) / Price

- **Kelly% = confidence - 0.5** (simplified)
- **Maximum position**: 15% of portfolio value
- **Minimum position**: 10% of portfolio value

### 5. **Stop-Loss & Take-Profit Rules**

#### Stop-Loss (confidence-based):
- **High confidence (â‰¥85%)**: 8% stop-loss (wider stop)
- **Medium confidence (75-85%)**: 6% stop-loss
- **Lower confidence**: 4% stop-loss (tighter protection)

#### Take-Profit (confidence-based):
- **High confidence (â‰¥85%)**: 25% target
- **Medium confidence (75-85%)**: 15% target
- **Lower confidence**: 10% target

### 6. **Position Swapping Logic**

Swap positions when:
- **New opportunity has >10% higher confidence** than weakest position
- **Current position is NOT in profit** (>5%)
- **Portfolio is at max positions** (12 positions)

**Why swap?**
- Constantly upgrade to best opportunities
- Don't swap winning positions
- Cut underperformers for better setups

### 7. **Exit Triggers**

Positions are closed when:
1. **Stop-loss hit** (price drops below stop)
2. **Take-profit hit** (price reaches target)
3. **Signal exit** (trend detector changes to SELL/DONT_TRADE)
4. **Position swap** (better opportunity identified)

## Safety Features

### No Look-Ahead Bias
- All signals generated using historical data only
- Stop-loss/take-profit based on entry conditions, not future knowledge
- Market regime detected using past data

### Realistic Constraints
- Transaction costs included
- Slippage modeled
- Cash constraints enforced
- Position limits respected

### Risk Management
- Stop-losses on every position
- Position sizing based on confidence
- Leverage reduced in unfavorable conditions
- Maximum position size limits

## Strategy Rules

### Entry Conditions
1. Signal must be BUY with â‰¥75% confidence
2. Available cash to open position
3. Room for position (< 12 positions)
4. Market regime considered for leverage

### Exit Conditions
1. Stop-loss hit (forced exit)
2. Take-profit hit (forced exit)
3. Signal changes to SELL/DONT_TRADE
4. Better opportunity available (swap)

### Position Management
- Monitor all positions daily
- Recalculate signals daily
- Check for better opportunities
- Apply stop-loss and take-profit rules

## Interpreting Results

### Time to $1M
- **< 3 years**: Aggressive strategy working well
- **3-5 years**: Realistic timeframe with moderate risk
- **> 5 years**: Conservative approach or challenging market
- **Target not reached**: Strategy needs refinement

### Win Rate
- **> 60%**: Good trend-following system
- **50-60%**: Acceptable if profit factor > 2
- **< 50%**: Need better signals or risk management

### Profit Factor
- **> 2.0**: Excellent risk/reward
- **1.5-2.0**: Good profitability
- **< 1.5**: Marginal profitability

## Next Steps

After running the backtest:

1. **Analyze trades** - Which trades were most profitable?
2. **Review exits** - Were stops too tight/wide?
3. **Adjust parameters** - Test different leverage levels
4. **Optimize** - Find best confidence thresholds
5. **Validate** - Run on different time periods

## Disclaimers

- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Backtest includes realistic costs but cannot model all market conditions
- Real-world slippage and commissions may vary
- Market conditions change over time
- Use results as guidance, not guarantee
